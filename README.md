## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

During this project, I strengthened my understanding of CSS Grid and Flexbox, particularly in building complex, responsive layouts. I also practiced using CSS custom properties to ensure consistency across the design and ease future modifications.

Hereâ€™s an example of how I used **CSS Grid** to structure the grid layout:

```css
.bento-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-areas:
    'box1 box2 box2 box3'
    'box1 box2 box2 box3'
    'box4 box5 box6 box3'
    'box4 box7 box8 box8';
  gap: 2rem;
}
```

This project helped me understand how to manage a grid for larger layouts and adapt it for smaller screens using media queries.

### Continued Development

In future projects, I want to focus more on refining my skills in:

- Advanced CSS Grid techniques for even more complex layouts
- Building better animations and transitions to improve the user experience
- Working more with accessibility best practices to ensure the project is inclusive for all users

### Useful Resources

- [CSS Tricks - A Complete Guide to Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This helped me understand how to effectively use CSS Grid for complex layouts.
- [MDN Web Docs - Media Queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries) - This resource was incredibly helpful for building responsive layouts.
